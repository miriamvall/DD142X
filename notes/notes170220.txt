severe - cant move
slow, tremors, posture
no or slow movement
movement initiation
complex hard
brain signatures
oscillations in lfp, beta-oscillations
	very prominent
beta - biomarker treat disease (symptomatically)
stimulation device
brain dynamics

Peter Brown - beta oscillations 2001

Three brain regions simultaneously
basal ganglea
How different is the population activity in these different regions in the same patient
	very different in terms of local structure
	however similar interconnected
	similarity measure
Based on available data can we classify patients into different categories, pref on severity
Information on 40 sessions and 100s recording each several animals 10ish

spectral domain
wavelet
temporal
beta-bursts
amplitude, length
stronger beta longer
