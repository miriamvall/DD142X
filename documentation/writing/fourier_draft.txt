The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is a method to decompose samples of a function into its' composing frequencies, with a measure of prominence for each such frequency.
Specifically, the DFT can be used to analyze which frequencies are prominent in time series data, such as the LFP measurements over time in a patient.
The frequencies of interest for the purpose of this project are those in the beta-range. 
As such, the DFT can be used to extract relevant features from the "rats" dataset.
One issue with the DFT is that its' output contains no information about change in the composing frequencies of the input over time.
One way to remedy this is to divide the input into shorter chunks, and use the DFT on each of these.
Applying this method, it's possible to produce data on how beta frequencies in the LFP change over time for a patient.

"rats" dataset = our dataset
"patient" = rat
